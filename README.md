# To-Do List

A simple and intuitive To-Do List web application built using vanilla **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently by adding, completing, and deleting tasks in a clean, minimalist and responsive interface.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Quickly add new tasks using an input field.
- **Mark as Complete**: Click on a task to mark it as completed or incomplete.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from your list when they're done.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in your browser's local storage, so your list is preserved even after refreshing the page.
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on both desktop and mobile devices.
